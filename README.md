# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Vizualization
This repo compares all popular ML algorithms and neural networks for achieving maximum accuracy of 95.0% for prediction of heart failure along with a detailed vizualization of all features. This accuracy was achieved by Random Forest Classifier and K-NN Classifier.

**Disclaimer** : Since github performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph, the graphs corresponding to vizualisation of non-categorical features are not visible. To view these graphs open the file with google colab.
